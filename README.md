As part of the novoda NCU i am going to start an old project from scratch thats totally test driven, uses firebase instead of coredata and facebook invites to the 'Table' with live updates as people choose items to pay for. In swift 4 on xcode 9 beta.


You will need to run `gem install earlgrey` then `pod install` before building :)
